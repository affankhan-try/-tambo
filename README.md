Built with Tambo's React SDK

--> The Vision
Static study tools are for Clones. The AI Study Helper is built for Jedis. Using Tambo's React SDK, this interface doesn't just display data - it adapts to the student's needs in real-time. Whether you are reviewing complex calculus or memorizing history dates, the AI chooses the most effective components to render for your specific learning style.

--> How it Uses the 'Force' (Tambo Features)
This project focuses on Dynamic Component Selection, ensuring the UI evolves as the conversation
progresses:- 
-Adaptive Dashboards: The AI decides when to show a 'Flashcard Component' vs. a 'Summary Chart' based on the study material.
- Context-Aware Interfaces: Uses Tambo's React SDK to swap out standard chat bubbles for interactive diagrams when the AI explains spatial concepts.
- The Jedi Mindset: A UI that anticipates the next step in the learning journey, reducing friction and maximizing focus.


Key Features
- Generative Study UI: No two study sessions look the same.
- Multi-Modal Learning: Adapts between text, task lists, and visual progress trackers.
- Tambo-Powered Logic: High-speed component rendering triggered by AI intent.

Tech Stack
